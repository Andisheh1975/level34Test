# COMP2110 Bob's Jobs Frontend

This project implements the front-end code for Bob's Jobs.

This project has four levels. level 1 to level four.
In level 1,2, I designed a website for jobs which has different jobs. i used json files 
to describe each job.

In level 3,4, included frontend and backend. we used Strapi for backend, upload data from json file to the backend.
unfortunatelly, I couldn't work on level3,4 as I had problem with connecting to frontend and backend.
